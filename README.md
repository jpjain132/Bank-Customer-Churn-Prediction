# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

A deep learning project using a multi-layer perceptron (Feed Forward Neural Network) to predict bank customer churn. Developed models to analyze extensive transactional data, achieving over 85% predictive accuracy through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning with Adam optimizer, and Binary-cross Entropy Classification.
Implemented TensorFlow and Keras to gain insights, decrease churn and improve customer retention.
